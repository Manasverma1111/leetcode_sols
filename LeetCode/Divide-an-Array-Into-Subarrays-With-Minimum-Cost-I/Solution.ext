Input: nums = [1,2,3,12]
Output: 6
Explanation: The best possible way to form 3 subarrays is: [1], [2], and [3,12] at a total cost of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
The other possible ways to form 3 subarrays are:
- [1], [2,3], and [12] at a total cost of 1 + 2 + 12 = 15.
- [1,2], [3], and [12] at a total cost of 1 + 3 + 12 = 16.
